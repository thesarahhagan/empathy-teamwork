# Hello? Is it empathy you're looking for?
Accompanying repository for the empathy and teamwork talk from Oracle November 2019.

# Abstract
We know DevOps culture requires increased collaboration between teams to move faster and be more agile. But what do you do when you’re forced to work with someone who just doesn’t get it, and how do you get to a place where work can happen seamlessly? This talk uses empirical research and practical tips to understand the perspective of others and bring empathy into your team.

### Working Agreements
This section got nixed from the talk, but it's still important to do with your teams! Set working agreements and make sure that everybody is on the same level. Note that just tactical working agreements are great, but also ensuring you have some behavioral expectations can really increase your team's ability to be productive.
